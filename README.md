Our datasets included hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from Jan 2010 to June 2015. We joined the data with the local historical weather data. In our finished project, we provided a ipynb file and sql queries to answer the questions. We also downloaded and preprocessed the data. We stored the data in SQLite database and provided the data visualization as required.
